Program to find Smallest and Largest elements from One Dimensional Array Elements.

To find Smallest element from the Array - We will assume that first element is smallest and assign it in a variable and then compare each element from array with the variable, if any of the element is smaller than variable assign that element into variable, finally we will get smallest elements.

To find Largest element from the Array - We will assume that first element is largest and assign it in a variable and then compare each element from array with the variable, if any of the element is larger than variable assign that element into variable, finally we will get largest elements.

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
         Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr= new int[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
        }
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        System.out.println(arr[0]);
        System.out.println(arr[n-1]);
    }
